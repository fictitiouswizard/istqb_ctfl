Software systems are an integral part of our daily life.  Most people have had experience with software that did not work as expected.  Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems, Including loss of money, time or business reputation, and in extreme cases, even injury or death.  Software testing assesses software quality and helps reducing the risk of software failure in operation.

Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software work products.  These work products, when being tested, are known as [[Test Object | test objects]].  A common misconception about testing is that it only consists of executing tests (i.e., running the software and checking the [[Test Result | test results]]).  However, software testing also includes other activities and must be aligned with the software development lifecycle (see [[2.0.  Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle | chapter 2]]).

Another common misconception about testing is that testing focuses entirely on verifying the [[Test Object | test object]].  While testing involves verification, i.e., checking whether the system meets specified requirements, it also involves validation, which means checking whether the system meets users' and other stakeholders' needs in its operational environment.

Testing may be dynamic or static.  [[Dynamic Testing | Dynamic testing]] involves the execution of software, while [[Static Testing | static testing]] does not.  Static testing includes [[Review | reviews]] (see [[3.0.  Static Testing | chapter 3]]) and [[Static Analysis | static analysis]].  Dynamic testing uses different types of [[Test Technique | test techniques]] and [[Test Approach | test approaches]] to derive [[Test Case | test cases]] (see [[4.0.  Test Analysis and Design | chapter 4]]).

Testing is not only a technical activity.  It also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated, monitored and controlled (see [[5.0.  Managing the Test Activities | chapter 5]]).

Testers use tools (see [[6.0.  Test Tools | chapter 6]]), but it is important to remember that testing is largely an intellectual activity, requiring the testers to have specialized knowledge, use analytical skills and apply critical thinking and systems thinking ([[The Art of Software Testing | Myers 2011]], [[Thinking-Driven Testing | Roman 2018]]).

The [[ISO-IEC-IEEE 29119-1 | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard]] provides further information about software testing concepts.

## 1.1.1. Test Objectives

The typical [[Test Objective | test objectives]] are:

* Evaluating work products such as requirements, user stories, designs, and code
* Causing [[Failure | failures]] and finding [[Defect | defects]]
* Ensuring required [[Coverage | coverage]] of a [[Test Object | test object]]
* Reducing the [[Risk | risk]] level of inadequate software quality
* Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
* Verifying that a [[Test Object | test object]] complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
* Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
* Building confidence in the [[Quality | quality]] of the [[Test Object | test object]]
* Validating whether the [[Test Object | test object]] is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders

[[Test Objective | Test objectives]] can vary, depending upon the context, which includes the work product being tested, the [[Test Level | test level]], [[Risk | risks]], the software development lifecycle (SDLC) being followed, and factors related to the business context, e.g., corporate structure, competitive considerations, or time to market.

## 1.1.2. Testing and Debugging

[[Testing]] and [[Debugging | debugging]] are separate activities.  [[Testing]] can trigger [[Failure | failures]] that are caused by [[Defect | defects]] in the software ([[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]]) or can directly find [[Defect | defects]] in the [[Test Object | test object]] ([[Static Testing | static testing]]).

When [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] (see [[4.0.  Test Analysis and Design | chapter 4]]) triggers a [[Failure | failure]], [[Debugging | debugging]] is concerned with finding causes of this [[Failure | failure]] ([[Defect | defects]]), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them.  The typical [[Debugging | debugging]] process in this case involves:

* Reproduction of a [[Failure | failure]]
* Diagnosis (finding the [[Defect | defect]])
* Fixing the [[Defect | defect]]

Subsequent [[Confirmation Testing | confirmation testing]] checks whether the fixes resolved the problem.  Preferably, [[Confirmation Testing | confirmation testing]] is done by the same person who performed the initial test.  Subsequent [[Regression Testing | regression testing]] can also be performed, to check whether the fixes are causing [[Failure | failures ]] in other parts of the [[Test Object | test object]] (see [[2.2.  Test Levels and Test Types#2.2.3. Confirmation Testing and Regression Testing | section 2.2.3]] for more information on [[Confirmation Testing | confirmation testing]] and [[Regression Testing | regression testing]]).

When [[Static Testing | static testing]] identifies a [[Defect | defect]], [[Debugging | debugging]] is concerned with removing it.  There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since [[Static Testing | static testing]] directly finds [[Defect | defects]], and cannot cause [[Failure | failures]] (see [[3.0.  Static Testing | chapter 3]]).
