##  3.2.1.  Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback

Early and frequent feedback allows for the early communication of potential quality problems.  If there is little stakeholder involvement during the SDLC, the product being developed might not meet the stakeholder's original or current vision.  A failure to deliver what the stakeholder wants can result in costly rework, missed deadlines, blame games, and might even lead to complete project failure.

Frequent stakeholder feedback throughout the SDLC can prevent misunderstandings about requirements and ensure that changes to requirements are understood and implemented earlier.  This helps the development team to improve their understanding of what they are building.  It allows them to focus on those features that deliver the most to the stakeholders and that have the most positive impact on identified risks.

##  3.2.2.  Review Process Activities

The [[ISO-IEC 20246 | ISO/IEC 20246 standard]] defines a generic review process that provides a structured but flexible framework form which a specific review process may be tailored to a particular situation.  If the required review is more formal, then more of the tasks described for the different activities will be needed.

The size of many work products makes them to large to be covered by a single review.  The review process may be invoked multiple times to complete the review for the entire work product.

The activities in the review process are:

* **Planning**.  During the planning phase, the scope of the review, which comprises the purpose, the work product to be reviewed, quality characteristics to be evaluated, areas to focus on, exit criteria, supporting information such as standards, effort and the timeframes for the review, shall be defined 
* **Review initiation**.  During review initiation, the goal is to make sure that everyone and everything involved is prepared to start the review.  This includes making sure that every participant has access to the work product under review, understands their role and responsibilities and receives everything needed to perform the review
* **Individual review**.  Every reviewer performs an individual review to assess the quality of the work product under review, and to identify anomalies, recommendations, and questions by applying one or more review techniques (e.g.,  checklist-based reviewing, scenario-based reviewing).  The [[ISO-IEC 20246 | ISO/IEC 20246 standard]] provides more depth on different review techniques.  The reviewers log all their identified anomalies, recommendations, and questions.
* **Communication and analysis**.  Since the anomalies identified during a review are not necessarily defects, all these anomalies need to be analyzed and discussed.  For every anomaly, the decision should be made on its status, ownership, and required actions.  This is typically done in a review meeting, during which the participants also decide what the quality level of reviewed work product is and what follow-up actions are required.  A follow-up review may be required to complete actions.
* **Fixing and reporting**.  For every defect, a defect report should be created so that corrective actions can be followed up.  Once the exit criteria are reached, the work product can be accepted.  The review results are reported.

##  3.2.3.  Roles and Responsibilities in Reviews

Reviews involve various stakeholders, who may take on several roles.  The principal roles and their responsibilities are:

* Manager -- decides what is to be reviewed and provides resources, such as staff and time for the review
* Author -- creates and fixes the work product under review
* Moderator (also known as the facilitator) -- ensures the effective running of review meetings, including mediation, time management, and safe review environment in which everyone can speak freely
* Scribe (also known as recorder) -- collates anomalies from reviewers and records review information, such as decisions and new anomalies found during the review meeting
* Reviewer -- performs reviews.  A reviewer may be someone working on the project, a subject matter expert, or any other stakeholder
* Review leader -- takes overall responsibility for the review such as deciding who will be involved, and organizing when and where the review will take place

Other, more detailed roles are possibility, as described in the [[ISO-IEC 20246 | ISO/IEC 20246 standard]].

##  3.2.4.  Review Types

There exist many review types ranging from informal reviews to formal reviews.  The required level of formality depends on factors such as the SDLC being followed, the maturity of the development process, the criticality and complexity of the work product being reviewed,  Legal or regulatory requirements, and the need for an audit trail.  The same work product can be reviewed with different review types, e.g., first an informal one and later a more formal one.

Selecting the right review type is key to achieving the required review objectives (see [[3.2.  Feedback and Review Process#3.2.5. Success Factors for Reviews | section 3.2.5]]).  The selection is not only based on the objectives, but also on factors such as the project needs, available resources, work product type and risks,  business domain, and company culture.

Some commonly used review types are:

* **Informal review**.  Informal reviews do not follow a defined process and do not require a formal document output.  The main objective is detecting anomalies.
* **Walkthrough**.  A walkthrough, which is led by the author, can serve many objectives, such as evaluating quality and building confidence in the work product, educating reviewers, gaining consensus, generating new idea, motivating and enabling authors to improve and detecting anomalies.  Reviewers might perform an individual review before the walkthrough, but this is not required.
* **Technical Review**.  A technical review is performed by technically qualified reviewers and led by a moderator.  The objectives of a technical review are to gain consensus and make decisions regarding a technical problem, but also to detect anomalies, evaluate quality and build confidence in the work product, generate new ideas, and to motivate and enable authors to improve.
* **Inspection**.  As inspections are the most formal type of review, they follow the complete generic process (see [[3.2.  Feedback and Review Process#3.2.2. Review Process Activities | section 3.2.2]]).  The main objective is to find the maximum number of anomalies.  Other objectives are to evaluate quality, build confidence in the work product, and to motivate and enable authors to improve.  Metrics are collected and used to improve the SDLC, including the inspection process.  In inspections, the author cannot act as the review leader or scribe.

##  3.2.5.  Success Factors for Reviews

There are several factors that determine the success of reviews, which include:

* Defining clear objectives and measurable exit criteria.  Evaluation of participants should never be an objective
* Choosing the appropriate review type to achieve the given objectives, and to suit the type of work product, the review participants, the project needs and context
* Performing reviews on small chunks, so that reviewers do not lose concentration during an individual review and/or the review meeting (when held)
* Providing feedback from reviews to stakeholders and authors so they can improve the product and their activities (see [[3.2.  Feedback and Review Process#3.2.1. Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback | section 3.2.1]])
* Providing adequate time to participants to prepare for the review
* Support from management for the review process
* Making reviews part of the organization's culture, to promote learning and process improvement
* Providing adequate training for all participants so they know how to fulfill their role
* Facilitating meetings
