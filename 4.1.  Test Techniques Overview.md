# 4.1. Test Techniques Overview

[[Test Technique]]s support the tester in [[Test Analysis | test analysis]] (what to test) and in [[Test Design | test design]] (how to test). [[Test Technique | Test techniques]] help to develop a relatively small, but sufficient, set of [[Test Case | test cases]] in a systematic way. [[Test Technique | Test techniques]] also help the tester to define [[Test Condition | test conditions]], identify [[Coverage Item | coverage items]], and identify [[Test Data | test data]] during the [[Test Analysis | test analysis]] and [[Test Design | design]]. Further information on [[Test Technique | test techniques]] can be found in the [[ISO-IEC-IEEE 29119-4 | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 standard]], and in ([[Software Testing Techniques | Beizer 1990]], [[Systematic Software Testing | Craig 2002]], [[A Practitioner's Guide to Software Test Design | Copeland 2004]], [[TMap Next for result-driven testing | Koomen 2006]], [[Software Testing, A Craftsman's Approach | Jorgensen 2014]], [[Introduction to Software Testing (2e) | Ammann 2016]], [[Practical Test Design | Forgacs 2019]]).

In this syllabus, test techniques are classified as black-box, white-box, and experience-based.

**[[Black-box test technique | Black-box test techniques]]** (also known as specification-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the [[Test Object | test object]] without reference to its internal structure.  Therefore, the [[Test Case | test cases]] are independent of how the software is implemented.  Consequently, if the implementation changes, but the required behavior stays the same, then the [[Test Case | test cases]] are still useful.

**[[White-box test technique | White-box test techniques]]** (also known as structure-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the [[Test Object | test object's]] internal structure and processing.  As the [[Test Case | test cases]] are dependent on how the software is designed, they can only be created after the design or implementation of the [[Test Object | test object]].

**[[Experience-based test technique | Experience-based test techniques]]** effectively use the knowledge and experience of testers for the design and implementation of [[Test Case | test cases]].  The effectiveness of these [[Test Technique | test techniques]] depends heavily on the tester's skills.  [[Experience-Based Test Technique | Experience-based test techniques]] can detect [[Defect | defects]] that may be missed using the [[Black-Box Test Technique | black-box test techniques]] and [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]].  Hence, [[Experience-Based Test Technique | experience-based test techniques]] are complementary to the [[Black-Box Test Technique | black-box test techniques]] and [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]].
