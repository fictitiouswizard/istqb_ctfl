Organizations face many internal and external factors that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives ([[ISO 31000 | ISO 31000]]).  Risk management allows the organizations to increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, Improve the quality of their products and increase the stakeholders' confidence and trust.

The main risk management activities are:

* Risk analysis (consisting of risk identification and risk assessment; see [[5.2.  Risk Management#5.2.3. Product Risk Analysis | section 5.2.3]])
* Risk control (consisting of risk mitigation and risk monitoring; see [[5.2.  Risk Management#5.2.4. Product Risk Control | section 5.2.4]])

The test approach, in which test activities are selected, prioritized, and managed based on risk analysis and risk control, is called risk-based testing.

##  5.2.1.  Risk Definition and Risk Attributes

Risk is a potential event, hazard, threat, or situation whose occurrence cases an adverse effect.  A risk can be characterized by two factors:

*  Risk likelihood -- the probability of the risk occurrence (greater than zero and less than one)
* Risk impact (harm) -- the consequences of this occurrence

These two factors express the risk level, which is a measure for the risk.  The higher the risk level, the more important is its treatment.

##  5.2.2.  Project Risks and Product Risks

In software testing one is generally concerned with two types of risks: project risks and product risks.

**Project risks** are related to the management and control of the project.  Project risks include:

* Organizational issues (e.g., delays in work products deliveries, inaccurate estimates, cost cutting)
* People issues (e.g., insufficient skills, conflicts, communication problems, shortage of staff)
* Technical issues (e.g., scope creep, poor tool support)
* Supplier issues (e.g., third-party delivery failure, bankruptcy of the supporting company)

Project risks, when the occur, may have an impact on the project schedule, budget or scope, which affects the project's ability to achieve it objectives.

**Product risks** are related to the product quality characteristics (e.g., described in the [[ISO-IEC 25010 | ISO 25010 quality model]]).  Examples of product risks include: missing or wrong functionality, incorrect calculations, runtime errors, poor architecture, inefficient algorithms, inadequate response time, poor user experience, security vulnerabilities.  Product risks, when they occur, may result in various negative consequences, including:

* User dissatisfaction
* Loss of revenue, trust, reputation
* Damage to third parties
* High maintenance costs, overload of the help desk
* Criminal penalties
* In extreme cases, physical damage, injuries or even death

##  5.2.3.  Product Risk Analysis

From a testing perspective, the goal of product risk analysis is to provide an awareness of product risk to focus the test effort in a way that minimizes the residual level of product risk.  Ideally, product risk analysis begins early in the SDLC.

Product risk analysis consists of risk identification and risk assessment.  Risk identification is about generating a comprehensive list of risks.  Stakeholders can identify risks by using  various techniques and tools, e.g., brainstorming, workshops, interviews, or cause-effect diagrams.  Risk assessment involves: categorization of identified risks, determining their risk likelihood, risk impact and risk level, prioritizing, and proposing ways to handle them.  Categorization helps in assigning mitigation actions, because usually risks falling into the same category can be mitigated using a similar approach.

Risk assessment can use a quantitative or qualitative approach, or a mix of them.  In the quantitative approach the risk level is calculated as the multiplication of risk likelihood and risk impact.  In the qualitative approach the risk level can be determined using a risk matrix.

Product risk analysis may influence the thoroughness and test scope.  Its results are used to:

* Determine the test scope to be carried out
* Determine the particular test levels and propose test types to be performed
* Determine the test techniques to be employed and the coverage to be achieved
* Estimate the test effort required for each task
* Prioritize testing in an attempt to find the critical defects as early as possible
* Determine whether any activities in addition to testing could be employed to reduce risk

##  5.2.4.  Product Risk Control

Product risk control comprises all measures that are taken in response to identified and assessed product risks.  Product risk control consists of risk mitigation and risk monitoring.  Risk mitigation involves implementing the actions proposed in risk assessment to reduce the risk level.  The aim of risk monitoring assessment, and to identify emerging risks.

With respect to product risk control, once a risk has been analyzed, several response options to risk are possible, e.g., risk mitigation by testing, risk acceptance, risk transfer, or a contingency plan ([[[Practical Risk-Based Testing | Veenendaal 2012]]]).  Actions that can be taken to mitigate the product risks by testing are as follows: 

* Select the testers with the right level of experience and skills, suitable for a given risk type
* Apply an appropriate level of independence of testing
* Perform reviews and static analysis
* Apply the appropriate test techniques and coverage levels
* Apply the appropriate test types addressing the affected quality characteristics
* Perform dynamic testing, including regression testing
