Test tools support and facilitate many test activities.  Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Test management tools -- increase the test process efficiency by facilitating management of the SDLC, requirements, tests, defects, configuration
* Static testing tools -- support the tester in performing reviews and static analysis
* Test design and test implementation tools -- facilitate generation of test cases, test data and test procedures
* Test execution and test coverage tools -- facilitate automated test execution and coverage measurement
* Non-functional testing tools -- allow the tester to perform non-functional testing that is difficult or impossible to perform manually
* DevOps tools -- support the DevOps delivery pipeline, workflow tracking, automated build process(es), CI/CD
* Collaboration tools -- facilitate communication
* Tools supporting scalability and deployment standardization (e.g., virtual machines, containerization tools)
* Any other tool that assists in testing (e.g., a spreadsheet is a test tool in the context of testing)
