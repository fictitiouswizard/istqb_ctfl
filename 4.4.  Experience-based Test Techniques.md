# 4.4. Experience-Based Test Techniques

Commonly used [[Experience-Based Test Technique | experience-based test techniques]] discussed in the following sections are:

* [[Error Guessing]]
* [[Exploratory Testing]]
* [[Checklist-Based Testing]]

## 4.4.1 Error Guessing

[[Error Guessing | Error guessing]] is a [[Test Technique | test technique]] used to anticipate the occurrence of [[Error | errors]], [[Defect | defects]], and [[Failure | failures]], based on the tester's knowledge, including:

* How the application has worked in the past
* The types of [[Error | errors]] the developers tend to make and the types of [[Defect | defects]] that result from these [[Error | errors]]
* The types of [[Failure | failures]] that have occurred in other, similar applications

In general, [[Error | errors]], [[Defect | defects]] and [[Failure | failures]] may be related to: input (e.g., correct input not accepted, parameters wrong or missing), output (e.g., wrong format, wrong result), logic (e.g., missing cases, wrong operator), computation (e.g., incorrect operand, wrong computation), interfaces (e.g., parameter mismatch, incompatible types), or data (e.g., incorrect initialization, wrong type).

Fault attacks are a way to implement [[Error Guessing | error guessing]].  This [[Test Technique | test technique]] requires the tester to create or acquire a list of possible [[Error | errors]], [[Defect | defects]] and [[Failure | failures]], and to design tests that will identify [[Defect | defects]] associated with the [[Error | errors]], expose the [[Defect | defects]], or cause the [[Failure | failures]].  These lists can be built based on experience, [[Defect | defect]] and [[Failure | failure]] data, or from common knowledge about why software fails.

See ([[How to Break Software | Whitaker 2002]], [[How to Break Software Security | Whittaker 2003]], [[How to Break Web Software | Andrews 2006]]) for more information on [[Error Guessing | error guessing]] and fault attacks.

## 4.4.2 Exploratory Testing

In [[Exploratory Testing | exploratory testing]], tests are simultaneously designed, executed, and evaluated while the tester learns about the [[Test Object | test object]].  The testing is used to learn more about the [[Test Object | test object]], to explore it more deeply with focused tests, and to create tests for untested areas.

[[Exploratory Testing | Exploratory testing]] is sometimes performed using session-based testing to structure the testing.  In a session-based approach, [[Exploratory Testing | exploratory testing]] is performed within a defined time box.  The tester uses a test charter containing [[Test Objective | test objectives]] to guide the testing.  The test session is usually followed by a debriefing that involves a discussion between the tester and stakeholders interested in the [[Test Result | test results]] of the test session.  In this approach [[Test Objective | test objectives]] may be treated as high-level [[Test Condition | test conditions]].  [[Coverage Item | Coverage items]] are identified and exercised during the test session.  The tester may use test session sheets to document the steps followed and the discoveries made.

[[Exploratory Testing | Exploratory testing]] is useful when there are few or inadequate specifications or there is significant time pressure on testing.  [[Exploratory Testing | Exploratory testing]] is also useful to complement other more formal [[Test Technique | test techniques]].  [[Exploratory Testing | Exploratory testing]] will be more effective if the tester is experienced , has domain knowledge and has a high degree of essential skills, like analytical skills, curiosity and creativeness (see [[1.5.  Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing#1.5.1. Generic Skills Required for Testing | section 1.5.1]]).

[[Exploratory Testing | Exploratory testing]] can incorporate the use of other [[Test Technique | test techniques]] (e.g., [[Equivalence Partitioning | equivalence partitioning]]).  More information about [[Exploratory Testing | exploratory testing]] can be found in ([[Testing Computer Software | Kaner 1999]], [[Exploratory Software Testing | Whittaker 2009]], [[Explore It! | Hendrickson 2013]]).

## 4.4.3. Checklist-Based Testing

In [[Checklist-Based Testing | checklist-based testing]], a tester designs, implements, and executes tests to cover [[Test Condition | test conditions]] from a checklist.  Checklists can be built based on experience, knowledge about what is important for the user, or an understanding of why and how software fails.  Checklists should not contain items that can be checked automatically, items better suited as [[Entry Criteria | entry criteria]], [[Exit Criteria | exit criteria]], or items that are to general ([[A survey of software inspection checklists | Brykczynki 1999]]).

Checklist items are often phrased in the form of a question.  It should be possible to check each item separately and directly.  These items may refer to requirements, graphical interface properties, quality characteristics or other forms of [[Test Condition | test conditions]].  Checklists can be created to support various [[Test Type | test types]], including [[Functional Testing | functional]] and [[Non-functional Testing | non-functional testing]] (e.g., 10 heuristics for usability testing ([[Enhancing the explanatory power of usability heuristics | Nielsen 1994]])).

Some checklist entries may gradually become less effective over time because the developers will learn to avoid making the same errors.  New entries may also need to be added to reflect newly found high severity [[Defect | defects]].  Therefor, checklists should be regularly  updated based on [[Defect | defect]] analysis.  However, care should be taken to avoid letting the checklist become too long ([[The Checklist Manifesto | Gawande 2009]]).

In the absence of detailed [[Test Case | test cases]], [[Checklist-Based Testing | checklist-based testing]] can provide guidelines and some degree of consistency for the testing.  If the checklists are high-level, some variability in the actual testing is likely to occur, resulting in potentially greater [[Coverage | coverage]] but less repeatability.
