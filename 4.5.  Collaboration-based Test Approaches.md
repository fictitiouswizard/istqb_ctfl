# 4.4. Experience-Based Test Techniques

Each of the above-mentioned [[Test Technique | test techniques]] (see sections [[4.2.  Black-Box Test Techniques | 4.2]], [[4.3.  White-Box Test Techniques | 4.3]], [[4.4.  Experience-based Test Techniques | 4.4]]) has particular objective with respect to [[Defect | defect]] detection.  Collaboration-based approaches, on the other hand, focus also on [[Defect | defect]] avoidance by collaboration and communication.

## 4.5.1.  Collaborative User Story Writing

A user story represents a feature that will be valuable to either a user or purchaser of a system or software.  User stories have three critical aspects ([[Extreme Programming Installed | Jeffries 2000]]), called together the "3 C's":

* Card - the medium describing a user story (e.g., an index card, an entry in an electronic board)
* Conversation - explains how the software will be used (can be documented or verbal)
* Confirmation - the [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] (see [[4.5.  Collaboration-based Test Approaches#4.5.2. Acceptance Criteria | section 4.5.2]])

The most common format for a user story is "As a \[role], I want \[goal to be accomplished], so that I can \[resulting business value for the role]", followed by the [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]].

Collaborative authorship of the user story can use techniques such as brainstorming and mind mapping.  The collaboration allows the team to obtain a shared vision of what should be delivered, by taking into account three perspectives: business, development and testing.

Good user stories should be: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small and Testable (INVEST).  If a stakeholder does not know how to test a user story, this may indicate that the user story is not clear enough, or that it does not reflect something valuable to them, or that the stakeholder just needs help in testing ([[INVEST in Good Stories and SMART Tasks | Wake 2003]]).

## 4.5.2.  Acceptance Criteria

[[Acceptance Criteria | Acceptance criteria]] for a user story are the conditions that an implementation of the user story must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.  From this perspective, [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] are usually a result of the Conversation (see section [[#4.5.1. Collaborative User Story Writing | 4.5.1]]).

[[Acceptance Criteria | Acceptance criteria]] are used to:

* Define the scope of the user story
* Reach consensus among the stakeholders
* Describe both positive and negative scenarios
* Serve as a basis for the user story [[Acceptance Testing | acceptance testing]] (see [[4.5.  Collaboration-based Test Approaches#4.5.3. Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD) | section 4.5.3]])
* Allow accurate planning and estimation

There are several ways to write [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] for a user story.  The two most common formats are:

* Scenario-oriented (e.g., Given/When/Then format used in BDD, see [[2.1.  Testing in the Context of a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)#2.1.3. Testing as a Driver for Software Development | section 2.1.3]])
* Rule-oriented (e.g., bullet point verification list, or tabulated form of input-output mapping)

Most [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] can be documented in one of these two formats.  However, the team may use another, custom format, as long as the [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] are well-defined and unambiguous.

## 4.5.3.  Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD)

[[ATDD]] is a test-first approach (see [[2.1.  Testing in the Context of a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)#2.1.3. Testing as a Driver for Software Development | section 2.1.3]]).  [[Test Case | Test cases]] are created prior to implementing the user story.  The [[Test Case | test cases]] are created by team members with different perspectives, e.g., customers, developers, and testers ([[Bridging the Communication Gap | Adzic 2009]]).  [[Test Case | Test cases]] may be executed manually or automated.

The first step is a specification workshop where the user story and (if not yet defined) its [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] are analyzed, discussed, and written by the team members. Incompleteness, ambiguities, or [[Defect | defects]] in the user story are resolved during this process.  The next step is to create the [[Test Case | test cases]].  This can be done by the team as a whole or by the tester individually.  The [[Test Case | test cases]] are based on the [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] and can be seen as examples of how the software works.  This will help the team implement the user story correctly.

Since examples and tests are the same, these terms are often used interchangeably.  During the [[Test Design | test design]] the [[Test Technique | test techniques]] described in sections [[4.2.  Black-Box Test Techniques | 4.2]], [[4.3.  White-Box Test Techniques | 4.3]] and [[4.4.  Experience-based Test Techniques | 4.4]] may be applied.

Typically, the first [[Test Case | test cases]] are positive, confirming the correct behavior without exceptions or error conditions, and comprising the sequence of activities executed if everything goes as expected.  After the positive [[Test Case | test cases]] are done, the team should perform negative testing.  Finally, the team should cover non-functional [[Quality | quality]] characteristics (e.g., performance efficiency, usability).  [[Test Case | Test cases]] should be expressed in a way that is understandable for the stakeholders.  Typically, [[Test Case | test cases]] contain sentences in natural language involving the necessary preconditions (if any), the inputs, and the postconditions.

The [[Test Case | test cases]] must cover all the characteristics of the user story and should not go beyond the story.  However, the [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]] may detail some of the issues described in the user story. In addition, no two [[Test Case | test cases]] should describe the same characteristics of the user story.

When captured in a format supported by a [[Test Automation | test automation]] framework, the developers can automate the [[Test Case | test cases]] by writing the supporting code as they implement the feature described by a user story.  The acceptance tests then become executable requirements.
