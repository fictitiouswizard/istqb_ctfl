[[Testing]], as a form of quality control, helps in achieving the agreed upon [[Test Objective | test objectives]] within the set scope, time, [[Quality | quality]], and budget constraints.  [[Testing | Testing's]] contribution to success should not be restricted to the test team activities.  Any stakeholder can use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success.  Testing components, systems, and associated work products (e.g., documentation) helps to identify [[Defect | defects]] in software.

## 1.2.1. Testing's Contributions to Success

[[Testing]] provides a cost-effective means of detecting [[Defect | defects]].  These [[Defect | defects]] can then be removed (by [[Debugging | debugging]] - a non-testing activity), so [[Testing | testing]] indirectly contributes to higher [[Quality | quality]] [[Test Object | test objects]].

[[Testing]] provides a means of directly evaluating the [[Quality | quality]] of a [[Test Object | test object]] at various phases in the SDLC.  These measures are used as part of a larger project management activity, contributing to decisions to move to the next phase of the SDLC, such as the release decision.

[[Testing]] provides users with indirect representation on the development project.  Testers ensure that their understanding of users' needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle.  The alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of the development project, which is not usually possible due to the high costs and lack of availability of suitable users.

[[Testing]] may also be required to meet contractual or legal requirements, or to comply with regulatory standards.

## 1.2.2. Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)

While people often use the terms "[[Testing | testing]]" and "[[Quality Assurance | quality assurance]]" (QA) interchangeably, [[Testing | testing]] and [[Quality Assurance | QA]] are not the same.

[[Testing]] is a product-oriented, corrective approach that focuses on those activities supporting the achievement of appropriate levels of [[Quality | quality]].  [[Testing]] is a major form of quality control, while others include formal methods (model checking and proof of correctness), simulation and prototyping.

[[Quality Assurance | QA]] is a process-oriented, preventive approach that focuses on the implementation and improvement of processes.  It works on the bases that if a good process is followed correctly, then it will generate a good product.  [[Quality Assurance | QA]] applies to both the development and testing processes, and is the responsibility of everyone on a project.

[[Test Result | Test results]] are used by [[Quality Assurance | QA]] and [[Testing | testing]].  In [[Testing | testing]] they are used to fix [[Defect | defects]], while in [[Quality Assurance | QA]] they provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing.

## 1.2.3.  Errors, Defects, Failures, Root Causes 

Human beings make [[Error | errors]] (mistakes), which produce [[Defect | defects]] (faults, bugs), which in turn may result in failures.  Humans make [[Error | errors]] for various reasons, such as time pressure, complexity of work products, processes, infrastructure or interactions, or simply because they are tired of lack adequate training.

[[Defect | Defects]] can be found in documentation, such as a requirements specification or a test script, in source code, or in a supporting work product such as a build file.  [[Defect | Defects]] in work products produced earlier in the SDLC, if undetected, often lead to defective work products later in the lifecycle.  if a [[Defect | defect]] in code is executed, the system may fail to do what it should do, or do something it shouldn't, causing a [[Failure | failure]].  Some [[Defect | defects]] will always result in a [[Failure | failure]] if executed, while others will only result in a [[Failure | failure]] in specific circumstances, and some may never result in a [[Failure | failure]].

[[Error | Errors]] and [[Defect | defects]] are not the only cause of [[Failure | failures]].  [[Failure | Failures]] can also be caused by environmental conditions, such as when radiation or electromagnetic fields cause [[Defect | defects]] in firmware.

A [[Root Cause | root cause]] is a fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem (e.g., a situation that leads to an [[Error | error]]).  [[Root Cause | Root causes]] are identified through root cause analysis, which is typically performed when a [[Failure | failure]] occurs or a [[Defect | defect]] is identified.  It is believed that further similar [[Failure | failures]] or [[Defect | defects]] can be prevented or their frequency reduced by addressing the [[Root Cause | root cause]], such as by removing it.
