## 4.2.1 Equivalence Partitioning

Equivalence Partitioning (EP) divides data into partitions (known as equivalence partitions) based on the expectation that all the elements of a given partition are to be processed in the same way by the test object.  The theory behind this technique is that if a test case, that tests one value from an equivalence partition, detects a defect, this defect should also be detected by test cases that test any other value from the same partition.  Therefore, one test for each partition is sufficient.

Equivalence partitions can be identified for any data element related to the test object, including inputs, outputs, configuration items, internal values, time-related values, and interface parameters.  The partitions may be continuous or discrete, ordered or unordered, finite or infinite.  The partitions must not overlap and must be non-empty sets.

For simple test items, EP can be easy, but in practice, understanding how the test object will treat different values is often complicated.  Therefore, partitioning should be done with care.

A partition containing valid values is called a valid partition.  A partition containing invalid values is called an invalid partition.  The definitions of valid and invalid values may vary among teams and organizations.  For example, valid values may be interpreted as those that should be processed by the test object or those for which the specifications defines there processing.  Invalid values may be interpreted as those that should be ignored or rejected by the test object or as those for which no processing is defined in the test object specification.

In EP, the coverage items are the equivalence partitions.  To achieve 100% coverage with this test technique, test cases mu exercise all identified partitions (including invalid partitions) by covering each partition at lease once.  Coverage is measured as the number of partitions exercised by at least one test case, divided by the total number of identified partitions. and is expressed as a percentage.

Many test items include multiple sets of partitions (e.g., test items with more than one input parameter) which means that a test case will cover partitions from different sets of partitions.  The simplest coverage criterion in the case of multiple sets of partitions is called Each Choice coverage ([[Ammann 2016]]).  Each Choice coverage requires test cases to exercise each partition from each set of partitions at least once.  Each Choice coverage does not take into account combinations of partititons.

## 4.2.2 Boundary Value Analysis

[[Boundary Value Analysis]] (BVA) is a test technique based on exercising the boundaries of equivalence partitions.  Therefore, BVA can only be used for ordered partitions.  The minimum and maximum values of a partition are its boundary values.  In the cases of BVA, if two elements belong to the same partition, all elements between them must also belong to that partition.

BVA focuses on the boundary values of the partitions because developers are more likely to make errors with these boundary values.  Typical defects found by BVA are located where implemented boundaries are misplaced to positions above or below their intended positions or are omitted altogether.

This syllabus covers two versions of the BVA: 2-value and 3-value BVA.  Thy differ in terms or coverage items per boundary that need to be exercised to achieve 100% coverage.

In 2-value BVA ([[Craig 2002]], [[Myers 2011]]), for each boundary value there are two coverage items: this boundary value and its closest neighbor belonging to the adjacent partition.  To achieve 100% coverage with 2-value BVA, test cases must exercise all coverage items, i.e., all identified boundary values.  Coverage is measured as the number of boundary values that were exercised, divided by the total number of identified boundary values, and is expressed as a percentage.

In 3-value BVA ([[Koomen 2006]], [[O'Regan 2019]]), for each boundary value there are three coverage items: this boundary value and both its neighbors.  Therefore, in 3-value BVA some of the coverage items may not be boundary values.  To achieve 100% coverage with 3-value BVA, test cases must exercise all coverage items, i.e., identified boundary values and their neighbors.  Coverage is measured as the number of boundary values and their neighbors exercised, divided by the total number of identified boundary values and their neighbors, and is expressed as a percentage.

3-Value BVA is more rigorous than 2-value BVA as it may detect defects overlooked by 2-value BVA.  For example, if the decision "if (x <= 10)..." is incorrectly implemented as "if (x = 10)...", no test data derived from the 2-value BVA (x = 10, x = 11) can detect the defect.  However, x = 9, derived from the 3-value BVA, is likely to detect it.

## 4.2.3 Decision Table Testing

Decision tables are used to testing the implementation of requirements that specify how different combinations of conditions result in different outcomes.  Decision tables are an effective way of recording complex logic, such as business rules.

When creating decision tables, the conditions and the resulting actions of the system are defined.  These form the rows of the table.  Each column corresponds to a decision rule that defines a unique combination of conditions, along with the associated actions.  In limited-entry decision tables all the values of the conditions are actions (except for irrelevant or infeasible ones; see below) are shown as Boolean values (true or false).  Alternatively, in extended decision tables some or all the conditions and actions may also take on multiple values (e.g., ranges of numbers, equivalence partitions, discrete values).

The notation for conditions is as follows: "T" (true) means that the condition is satisfied. "F" (false) means that the condition is not satisifed. "-" means that the value of the condition is irrelevant for the action outcome. "N/A" means that the condition is infeasible for a given rule.  For actions: "X" means that the action should occur.  Blank means that the action should not occur.  Other notations may also be used.

A full decision table has enough columns to cover every combination of conditions.  The table can be simplified by deleting columns containing infeasible combinations of conditions.  The table can also be minimized by merging columns, in which some conditions do not affect the outcome, into a single column.  Decision table minimization algorightms are our of scope of this syllabus.

In decision table testing, the coverage items are the columns containing feasible combinations of conditions.  To achieve 100% coverage with this technique, test cases must exercise all these columns.  Coverage is measured as the number of exercised columns, divided by the total number of feasible columns, and is expressed as a percentage.

The strength of decision table testing is that it provides a systematic approach to identify all the combinations of conditions, some of which might otherwise be overlooked, It also helps to find any gaps or contradictions in the requirements. if there are many conditions, exercising all the decision rules may be time consuming, since the number of rules grows exponentially with the number of conditions. In such a case, to reduce the number of rules that need to be exercised, a minimized decision table or a risk-based approach may be used.

## 4.2.4 State Transition Testing

A state diagram models the behavior of a system by showing its possible states and valid state transitions.  A transition is initiated by an event, which may be additionally qualified by a guard condition.  The transitions are assumed to be instantaneous and may sometimes result in the softare taking action.  The common transition labeling syntax is as follows: "event \[guard condition\] / action".  Guard conditions and actions can be omitted if they do not exist or are irrelevant for the tester.

A state table is a model equivalent to a state diagram.  Its rows represent states, and its columns represent events (together with guard conditions if they exist).  Table entries (cells) represent transitions, and contain the target state, as well as the resulting actions, if defined.  In contrast to the state diagram, the state table explicitly shows invalid transitions, which are represented by empty cells.

A test case based on a state diagram or state table is usually represented as a sequence of events, which results in a sequence of state changes (and actions, if needed).  One test case may, and usually will, cover several transitions between states.

There exists many coverage criteria for state transition testing.  This syllabus discusses three of them.

In **all states coverage**, the coverage items are the states. To achieve 100% all states coverage, test cases must ensure that all the states are exercised.  Coverage is measured as the number of exercised states divided by the total number of states and is expressed as a percentage.

In **valid transitions coverage** (also called 0-switch coverage), the coverage items are single valid transitions.  To achieve 100% valid transitions coverage, test cases must exercise all the valid transitions.  Coverage is measured as the number of exercised valid transitions divided by the total number of valid transitions and is expressed as a percentage.

In **all transitions coverage**, the coverage items are all the transitions shown in a state table.  To achieve 100% all transitions coverage, test cases must exercise all the valid transitions and attempt to execute invalid transitions.  Testing only one invalid transition in a single test case helps to avoid defect masking,  i.e., a situation in which one defect prevents the detection of another.  Coverage is measured as the number of valid and invalid transitions exercised or attempted to be covered by executed test cases, divided by the total number of valid and invalid transitions, and is expressed as a percentage.

All states coverage is weaker than valid transitions coverage, because it can typically be achieved without exercising all the transitions.  Valid transitions coverage is the most widely used coverage criterion.  Achieving full valid transitions coverage guarantees full all states coverage.  Achieving full all transitions coverage guarantees both full states coverage and full valid transitions coverage and should be a minimum requirement for mission and safety-critical software.
