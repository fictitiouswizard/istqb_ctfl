 A number of testing principles offering general guidelines applicable to all testing have been suggested over the years.  This syllabus describes seven such principles.

1. **[[Testing]] shows the presence, not the absence of [[Defect | defects]]**.  [[Testing]] can show that [[Defect | defects]] are present in the [[Test Object | test object]], but cannot prove that there are no [[Defect | defects]] ([[Software Engineering Techniques | Buxton 1970]]).  [[Testing]] reduces the probability of [[Defect | defects]] remaining undiscovered in the [[Test Object | test object]], but even if no [[Defect | defects]] are found, [[Testing | testing]] cannot prove [[Test Object | test object]] correctness.
2. **Exhaustive [[Testing | testing]] is impossible**.  [[Testing]] everything is not feasible except in trivial cases ([[The logic of computer programming | Manna 1978]]).  Rather than attempting to test exhaustively, [[Test Technique | test techniques]] (see [[4.0.  Test Analysis and Design | chapter 4]]), [[Test Case | test case]] prioritization (see [[5.1.  Test Planning#5.1.5. Test Case Prioritization | section 5.1.5]]), and [[Risk-Based Testing | risk-based testing]] (see [[5.2.  Risk Management | section 5.2]]), should be used to focus test efforts.
3. **Early testing saves time and money**.  [[Defect | Defects]] that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent [[Defect | defects]] in derived work products.  The cost of [[Quality | quality]] will be reduced since fewer [[Failure | failures]] will occur later in the [[SDLC]] ([[Software Engineering Economics | Boehm 1981]]).  To find [[Defect | defects]] early, both [[Static Testing | static testing]] (see [[3.0.  Static Testing | chapter 3]]) and [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] (see [[4.0.  Test Analysis and Design| chapter 4]]) should be started as early as possible.
4. **[[Defect | Defects]] cluster together**.  A small number of system components usually contain most of the [[Defect | defects]] discovered or are responsible for most of the operational [[Failure | failures]] ([[An Analysis of Errors and Their Causes in System Programs | Enders 1975]]).  This phenomenon is an illustration of the Pareto principle.  Predicted defect clusters, and actual defect clusters observed during [[Testing | testing]] or in operation, are an important input for [[Risk-Based Testing | risk-based testing]] (see [[5.2.  Risk Management | section 5.2]]).
5. **Tests ware out**.  If the same tests are repeated many times, they become increasingly ineffective in detecting new [[Defect | defects]] ([[Software Testing Techniques | Beizer 1990]]).  To overcome this effect, existing tests and [[Test Data | test data]] may need to be modified, and new tests may need to be written.  However, in some cases, repeating the same tests can have a beneficial outcome, e.g., in automated [[Regression Testing | regression testing]] (see [[2.2.  Test Levels and Test Types#2.2.3. Confirmation Testing and Regression Testing | section 2.2.3]]).
6. **[[Testing]] is context dependent**.  There is no single universally applicable approach to [[Testing | testing]].  [[Testing]] is done differently in different contexts ([[Lessons Learned in Software Testing | Kaner 2011]]).
7. **Absence-of-defects fallacy**.  It is a fallacy (i.e., a misconception) to expect that software [[Verification | verification]] will ensure the success of a system.  Thoroughly testing all the specified requirements and fixing all the [[Defect | defects]] found could still produce a system that does not fulfill the users' needs and expectations, that does not help in achieving the customer's business goals, and that is inferior compared to other competing systems.  In addition to [[Verification | verification]], [[Validation | validation]] should also be carried out ([[Software Engineering Economics | Boehm 1981]]).
