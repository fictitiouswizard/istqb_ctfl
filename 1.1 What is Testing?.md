 Objectives
 - (K1) Identify typical test objectives
 - (K2) Differentiate testing from debugging


1) Typical test objectives are:
	- Evaluating work products such as requirements, user stories, designs, and code
	- Causing failures and finding defects.]
	- Ensuring required coverage of a test object
	- Reducing the risk level of inadequate software quality
	- Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
	- Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
	- Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
	- Building confidence in the quality of the test object
	- Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders
2) Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects in the software ([[Dynamic Testing]]) or can directly find defects in the test object ([[Static Testing]]).  When [[Dynamic Testing]] triggers a failure, debugging is concerned with finding causes of the failure ([[Defect]]s), analyzing the causes, and eliminating them.
