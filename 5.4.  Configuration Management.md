# 5.4. Configuration Management 

In testing, configuration management (CM) provides a discipline for identifying, controlling, and tracking work products such as [[Test Plan | test plans]], [[Test Strategy | test strategies]], [[Test Condition | test conditions]], [[Test Case | test cases]], test scripts, [[Test Result | test results]], test logs, and test reports as configuration items.

For a complex configuration item (e.g., a test environment), [[CM]] records the items it consists of, their relationships, and versions.  If the configuration item is approved for [[Testing | testing]], it becomes a baseline and can only be changed through a formal change control process.

Configuration management keeps a record of changed configuration items when a new baseline is created.  It is possible to revert to a previous baseline to reproduce previous [[Test Result | test results]].

To properly support [[Testing | testing]], [[CM]] ensures the following:

* All configuration items, including test items (individual parts of the [[Test Object | test object]]), are uniquely identified, version controlled, tracked for changes, and related to other configuration items so that traceability can be maintained throughout the test process
* All identified documentation and software items are referenced unambiguously in [[Testware | testware]]

Continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment and the associated testing are typically implemented as part of an automated DevOps pipeline (see [[2.1.  Testing in the Context of a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)#2.1.4. DevOps and Testing | section 2.1.4]]), in which automated [[CM]] is normally included.
