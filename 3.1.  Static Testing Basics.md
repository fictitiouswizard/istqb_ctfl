# 3.1. Static Testing Basics

In contrast to [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]], in [[Static Testing | static testing]] the software under test does not need to be executed.  Code, process specification, system architecture specification or other work products are evaluated through manual examination (e.g., [[Review | reviews]]) or with the help of a tool (e.g., [[Static Analysis | static analysis]]).  [[Test Objective | Test objectives]] include improving quality, detecting [[Defect | defects]] and assessing characteristics like readability, completeness, correctness, testability and consistency.  [[Static Testing | Static testing]] can be applied for both [[Verification | verification]] and [[Validation | validation]].

Testers, business representatives (Product Owner, business analyst etc.) and developers work together during example mapping, collaborative user story writing and backlog refinement sessions to ensure that user stories and related work products meet defined criteria, e.g., the Definition of Ready (see [[5.1.  Test Planning#5.1.3. Entry Criteria and Exit Criteria | section 5.1.3]]).  Review techniques can be applied to ensure user stories are complete and understandable and include testable [[Acceptance Criteria | acceptance criteria]].  By asking the right questions, testers explore, challenge and help improve the proposed user stories.

[[Static Analysis | Static analysis]] can identify problems prior to [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] while often requiring less effort, since no [[Test Case | test cases]] are required, and tools (see [[6.0.  Test Tools | chapter 6]]) are typically used.  [[Static Analysis | Static analysis]] is often incorporated into CI frameworks (see [[2.1.  Testing in the Context of a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)#2.1.4. DevOps and Testing | section 2.1.4]]).  While largely used to detect specific code [[Defect | defects]], [[Static Analysis | static analysis]] is also used to evaluate maintainability and security.  Spelling checkers and readability tools are other examples of [[Static Analysis | static analysis]] tools.

##  3.1.1.  Work Products Examinable by Static Testing

Almost any work product can be examined using [[Static Testing | static testing]].  Examples include requirement specification documents, source code, [[Test Plan | test plans]], [[Test Case | test cases]], product backlog items, test charters, project documentation, contracts and models.

Any work product that can be read and understood can be the subject of a [[Review | review]].  However, for [[Static Analysis | static analysis]], work products need a structure against which they can be checked (e.g., models, code or text with a formal syntax).

Work products that are not appropriate for [[Static Testing | static testing]] include those that are difficult to interpret by human beings and that should not be analyzed by tools (e.g., 3rd party executable code due to legal reasons).

##  3.1.2.  Value of Static Testing

[[Static Testing | Static testing]] can detect [[Defect | defects]] in the earliest phases of the [[SDLC]], fulfilling the principle of early [[Testing | testing]] (see [[1.3.  Testing Principles | section 1.3]]).  It can also identify [[Defect | defects]] which cannot be detected by [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] (e.g., unreachable code, design patterns not implemented as desired, [[Defect | defects]] in non-executable work products).

[[Static Testing | Static testing]] provides the ability to evaluate the [[Quality | quality]] of, and to build confidence in work products.  By verifying the documented requirements, the stakeholders can also make sure that these requirements describe their actual needs.  Since [[Static Testing | static testing]] can be performed early in the [[SDLC]], a shared understanding can be created among the involved stakeholders.  Communication will also be improved between the involved stakeholders.  For this reason, it is recommended to involve a wide variety of stakeholders in [[Static Testing | static testing]].

Even though [[Review | reviews]] can be costly to implement, the overall project costs are usually much lower than when no [[Review | reviews]] are performed because less time and effort needs to be spent on fixing [[Defect | defects]] later in the project.

Certain code [[Defect | defects]] can be detected using [[Static Analysis | static analysis]] more efficiently than in [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]], usually resulting in both fewer code [[Defect | defects]] and a lower overall development effort.

##  3.1.3.  Differences between Static Testing and Dynamic Testing

[[Static Testing | Static testing]] and [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] practices complement each other.  They have similar objectives, such as supporting the detection of [[Defect | defects]] in work products (see [[1.1.  What is Testing#1.1.1. Test Objectives| section 1.1.1]]), but there are also some differences, such as:

* [[Static Testing | Static testing]] and [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] (with analysis of failures) can both lead to the detection of [[Defect | defects]], however there are some [[Defect | defect]] types that can only be found by either [[Static Testing | static]] or [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]].
* [[Static Testing | Static testing]] finds [[Defect | defects]] directly, while [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] causes [[Failure | failures]] from which the associated [[Defect | defects]] are determined through subsequent analysis.
* [[Static Testing | Static testing]] may more easily detect [[Defect | defect]] that lay on paths through the code that are rarely executed or hard to reach using [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]].
* [[Static Testing | Static testing]] can be applied to non-executable work products, while [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] can only be applied to executable work products.
* [[Static Testing | Static testing]] can be used to measure quality characteristics that are not dependent on executing code (e.g., maintainability), while [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] can be used to measure quality characteristics that are dependent on executing code (e.g., performance efficiency)

Typical [[Defect | defects]] that are easier and/or cheaper to find through [[Static Testing | static testing]] include:

* [[Defect | Defects]] in requirements (e.g., inconsistencies, ambiguities, contradictions, omissions, inaccuracies, duplication)
* Design [[Defect | defects]] (e.g., inefficient database structures, poor modularization)
* Certain types of coding [[Defect | defect]] (e.g., variables with undefined values, undeclared variables, unreachable or duplicated code, excessive code complexity)
* Certain types of coding [[Defect | defects]] (e.g., variables with undefined values, undeclared variables, unreachable or duplicated code, excessive code complexity)
* Deviations from standards (e.g., lack of adherence to naming conventions in coding standards)
* Incorrect interface specifications (e.g., mismatched number, type or order of parameters)
* Specific types of security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows)
* Gaps or inaccuracies in test basis coverage (e.g., missing tests for an acceptance criterion)
