# 5.5. Defect Management

Since one of the major [[Test Objective | test objectives]] is to find [[Defect | defects]], an established [[Defect Management | defect management]] process is essential.  Although we refer to "defects" here, the reported anomalies may turn out to be real [[Defect | defects]] or something else (e.g., false-positive result, change request) - this is resolved during the process of dealing with the [[Defect Report | defect reports]].  Anomalies may be reported during any phase of the [[SDLC]] and the form depends on the [[SDLC]].  At a minimum, the [[Defect Management | defect management]] process includes a workflow for handling individual [[Defect | defects]] or anomalies for their discovery to their closure and rules for their classification.  The workflow typically comprises activities to log the reported anomalies, analyze and classify them, decide on a suitable response such as to fix or keep it as it is and finally to close the [[Defect Report | defect report]].  The process must be followed by all involved stakeholders.  It is advisable to handle [[Defect | defects]] from [[Static Testing | static testing]] (especially [[Static Analysis | static analysis]]) in a similar way.


Typical [[Defect Report | defect reports]] have the following objectives:

* Provide those responsible for handling and resolving reported defects with sufficient information to resolve the issue
* Provide a means of tracking the quality of the work product
* Provide ideas for improvement of the development and test process

A [[Defect Report | defect report]] logged during [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]] typically includes:

* Unique identifier
* Title with a short summary of the anomaly being reported
* Date when the anomaly was observed, issuing organization, and author, including their role
* Identification of the [[Test Object | test object]] and test environment
* Context of the [[Defect | defect]] (e.g., [[Test Case | test case]] being run, test activity being performed, [[SDLC]] phase, and other relevant information such as the [[Test Technique | test technique]], checklist or test data being used)
* Description of the [[Failure | failure]] to enable reproduction and resolution including the test steps that detected the anomaly, and any relevant test logs, database dumps, screenshots, or recordings
* Expected results and actual results
* Severity of the [[Defect | defect]] (degree of impact) on the interests of stakeholders or requirements
* Priority to fix
* Status of the [[Defect | defect]] (e.g., open, deferred, duplicate, waiting to be fixed, awaiting confirmation testing, re-opened, closed, rejected)
* References (e.g., to the [[Test Case | test case]])

Some of this data may be automatically included when using [[Defect Management | defect management]] tools (e.g., identifier, date, author and initial status).  Document templates for a [[Defect Report | defect report]] and example [[Defect Report]] can be found in the [[ISO-IEC-IEEE 29119-3 | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 standard]], which refers to [[Defect Report | defect reports]] and incident reports.
