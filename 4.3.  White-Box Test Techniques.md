# 4.3. White-Box Test Techniques

Because of their popularity and simplicity, this section focuses on two code-related [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]]:

* Statement testing
* Branch testing

There are more rigorous [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]] that are used in some safety-critical, mission-critical, or high-integrity environments to achieve more thorough code [[Coverage | coverage]].  There are also [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]] used in higher [[Test Level | test levels]] (e.g., API Testing), or using [[Coverage | coverage]] not related to code (e.g., neuron coverage in neural network testing).  These techniques are not discussed in this syllabus.

## 4.3.1. Statement Testing and Statement Coverage

In statement testing, the [[Coverage Item | coverage items]] are executable statements.  The aim is to design [[Test Case | test cases]] that exercise statements in the code until an acceptable level of [[Coverage | coverage]] is achieved.  [[Coverage]] is measured as the number of statements exercised by the [[Test Case | test cases]] divided by the total number of executable statements in the code, and is expressed as a percentage.

When 100% [[Statement Coverage | statement coverage]] is achieved, it ensures that all executable statements in the code have been exercised at least once.  In particular, this means that each statement with a [[Defect | defect]] will be executed, which may cause a failure demonstrating the presence of the [[Defect | defect]].  However, exercising a statement with a [[Test Case | test case]] will not detect [[Defect | defects]] in all cases.  For example, it may not detect [[Defect | defects]] that are data dependent (e.g., a division by zero that only fails when a denominator is set to zero).  Also, 100% [[Statement Coverage | statement coverage]] does not ensure that all the decision logic has been tested as, for instance, it may not exercise all the branches (see chapter [[4.3.  White-Box Test Techniques#4.3.2. Branch Testing and Branch Coverage | 4.3.2]]) in the code.

## 4.3.2. Branch Testing and Branch Coverage

A branch is a transfer of control between two nodes in the control flow graph, which shows the possible sequences in which source code statements are executed in the [[Test Object | test object]]. Each transfer of control can be either unconditional (i.e., straight-line code) or conditional (i.e., a decision outcome).

In branch testing the [[Coverage Item | coverage items]] are branches and the aim is to design [[Test Case | test cases]] to exercise branches in the code until an acceptable level of [[Coverage | coverage]] is achieved.  [[Coverage]] is measured as the number of branches exercised by the [[Test Case | test cases]] divided by the total number of branches and is expressed as a percentage.

When 100% [[Branch Coverage | branch coverage]] is achieved, all branches in the code, unconditional and conditional, are exercised by [[Test Case | test cases]].  Conditional branches typically correspond to a true or false outcome from an "if...then" decision, an outcome from a switch/case statement or a decision to exit or continue in a loop.  However, exercising a branch with a [[Test Case | test case]] will not detect [[Defect | defects]] in all cases.  For example, it may not detect [[Defect | defects]] requiring the execution of a specific path in a code.

[[Branch Coverage | Branch coverage]] subsumes [[Statement Coverage | statement coverage]].  This means that any set of [[Test Case | test cases]] achieving 100% [[Branch Coverage | branch coverage]] also achieves 100% [[Statement Coverage | statement coverage]] (but not vice versa).

## 4.3.3 The Value of White-box Testing

A fundamental strength that all [[White-Box Test Technique | white-box test techniques]] share is that the entire software implementation is taken into account during testing, which facilitates [[Defect | defect]] detection even when the software specification is vague, outdated, or incomplete.  A corresponding weakness is that if the software does not implement one or requirements, [[White-Box Testing | white-box testing]] may not detect the resulting [[Defect | defects]] of omission ([[Structured Testing | Watson 1996]]).

[[White-Box Test Technique | White-box test techniques]] can be used in [[Static Testing | static testing]] (e.g., during dry runs of code). They are well suited to reviewing code not yet ready for execution ([[The Complete Guide to Software Testing | Hetzel 1988]]), pseudocode and other high-level or top-down logic which can be modeled with a control flow graph.

Preforming only [[Black-Box Testing | black-box testing]] does not provide a measure of actual code [[Coverage | coverage]].  White-box [[Coverage | coverage]] measures provide an objective measurement of [[Coverage | coverage ]] and the necessary information to allow additional tests to be generated to increase this [[Coverage | coverage]], and subsequently increase confidence in the code.
