Organizations face many internal and external factors that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives ([[ISO 31000 | ISO 31000]]).  [[Risk Management | Risk management]] allows the organizations to increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, Improve the [[Quality | quality]] of their products and increase the stakeholders' confidence and trust.

The main [[Risk Management | risk management]] activities are:

* [[Risk Analysis | Risk analysis]] (consisting of risk identification and risk assessment; see [[5.2.  Risk Management#5.2.3. Product Risk Analysis | section 5.2.3]])
* [[Risk Control | Risk control]] (consisting of risk mitigation and risk monitoring; see [[5.2.  Risk Management#5.2.4. Product Risk Control | section 5.2.4]])

The test approach, in which test activities are selected, prioritized, and managed based on [[Risk Analysis | risk analysis]] and [[Risk Control | risk control]], is called [[Risk-Based Testing | risk-based testing]].

##  5.2.1.  Risk Definition and Risk Attributes

[[Risk]] is a potential event, hazard, threat, or situation whose occurrence cases an adverse effect.  A [[Risk | risk]] can be characterized by two factors:

*  Risk likelihood -- the probability of the risk occurrence (greater than zero and less than one)
* Risk impact (harm) -- the consequences of this occurrence

These two factors express the [[Risk Level | risk level]], which is a measure for the risk.  The higher the [[Risk Level | risk level]], the more important is its treatment.

##  5.2.2.  Project Risks and Product Risks

In software testing one is generally concerned with two types of [[Risk | risks]]: [[Project Risk | project risks]] and [[Product Risk | product risks]].

**Project risks** are related to the management and control of the project.  [[Project Risk | Project risks]] include:

* Organizational issues (e.g., delays in work products deliveries, inaccurate estimates, cost cutting)
* People issues (e.g., insufficient skills, conflicts, communication problems, shortage of staff)
* Technical issues (e.g., scope creep, poor tool support)
* Supplier issues (e.g., third-party delivery failure, bankruptcy of the supporting company)

[[Project Risk | Project risks]], when they occur, may have an impact on the project schedule, budget or scope, which affects the project's ability to achieve its objectives.

**Product risks** are related to the product quality characteristics (e.g., described in the [[ISO-IEC 25010 | ISO 25010 quality model]]).  Examples of [[Product Risk | product risks]] include: missing or wrong functionality, incorrect calculations, runtime errors, poor architecture, inefficient algorithms, inadequate response time, poor user experience, security vulnerabilities.  [[Product Risk | Product risks]], when they occur, may result in various negative consequences, including:

* User dissatisfaction
* Loss of revenue, trust, reputation
* Damage to third parties
* High maintenance costs, overload of the help desk
* Criminal penalties
* In extreme cases, physical damage, injuries or even death

##  5.2.3.  Product Risk Analysis

From a testing perspective, the goal of product risk analysis is to provide an awareness of [[Product Risk | product risk]] to focus the test effort in a way that minimizes the residual level of [[Product Risk | product risk]].  Ideally, product risk analysis begins early in the [[SDLC]].

Product risk analysis consists of [[Risk Identification | risk identification]] and [[Risk Assessment | risk assessment]].  [[Risk Identification | Risk identification]] is about generating a comprehensive list of [[Risk | risks]].  Stakeholders can identify [[Risk | risks]] by using  various techniques and tools, e.g., brainstorming, workshops, interviews, or cause-effect diagrams.  [[Risk Assessment | Risk assessment]] involves: categorization of identified [[Risk | risks]], determining their risk likelihood, risk impact and [[Risk Level | risk level]], prioritizing, and proposing ways to handle them.  Categorization helps in assigning mitigation actions, because usually [[Risk | risks]] falling into the same category can be mitigated using a similar approach.

[[Risk Assessment | Risk assessment]] can use a quantitative or qualitative approach, or a mix of them.  In the quantitative approach the [[Risk Level | risk level]] is calculated as the multiplication of risk likelihood and risk impact.  In the qualitative approach the [[Risk Level | risk level]] can be determined using a risk matrix.

Product risk analysis may influence the thoroughness and test scope.  Its results are used to:

* Determine the test scope to be carried out
* Determine the particular [[Test Level | test levels]] and propose [[Test Type | test types]] to be performed
* Determine the [[Test Technique | test techniques]] to be employed and the coverage to be achieved
* Estimate the test effort required for each task
* Prioritize testing in an attempt to find the critical [[Defect | defects]] as early as possible
* Determine whether any activities in addition to testing could be employed to reduce [[Risk | risk]]

##  5.2.4.  Product Risk Control

Product risk control comprises all measures that are taken in response to identified and assessed [[Product Risk | product risks]].  Product risk control consists of [[Risk Mitigation | risk mitigation]] and [[Risk Monitoring | risk monitoring]].  [[Risk Mitigation | Risk mitigation]] involves implementing the actions proposed in [[Risk Assessment | risk assessment]] to reduce the [[Risk Level | risk level]].  The aim of risk monitoring is to ensure that the mitigation actions are effective, to obtain further information to improve risk assessment, and to identify emerging [[Risk | risks]].

With respect to product risk control, once a [[Risk | risk]] has been analyzed, several response options to [[Risk | risk]] are possible, e.g., [[Risk Mitigation | risk mitigation]] by [[Testing | testing]], risk acceptance, risk transfer, or a contingency plan ([[[Practical Risk-Based Testing | Veenendaal 2012]]]).  Actions that can be taken to mitigate the [[Product Risk | product risks]] by [[Testing | testing]] are as follows: 

* Select the testers with the right level of experience and skills, suitable for a given risk type
* Apply an appropriate level of independence of [[Testing | testing]]
* Perform [[Review | reviews]] and [[Static Analysis | static analysis]]
* Apply the appropriate [[Test Technique | test techniques]] and coverage levels
* Apply the appropriate [[Test Type | test types]] addressing the affected quality characteristics
* Perform [[Dynamic Testing | dynamic testing]], including [[Regression Testing | regression testing]]
